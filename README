Outputs all files onto page from a directory/folder on your server

Use as follows:

{exp:file_directory directory="path/to/folder/" wrap=""}

directory (required) - path starts at web root of your website, so it begins at the same level that your system folder does,
also do not start the path with a '/' at the beginning, only at the end '/', as seen above in the directory parameter

wrap (optional) - put within paragraph, div or span tags, see below

wrap="p" would put it within <p></p>
wrap="div" would put it within <div></div>
wrap="span" would put it within <span></span>

* if you get an error or nothing displays, be sure to check the path you passed to the directory parameter
